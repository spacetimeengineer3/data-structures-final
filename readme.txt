Fireground Managment System (FMS)

This is a program designed to help incident commanders with Fire Scene Management.

If you have no knowledge of a disaster-type incident, here is some backgroud informaiton.

The fire scene is divieded into three zones, the hot zone, the warm zone and the cold zone

The hot zone is the active scene. The requirements are listed in a later section

The Warm zone is close to the active scene, therefore the active scene can still hurt someone, in the event of say a building collapse or an explosion (or active shooter in the police case)

The cold zone is the zone in which the risk in miniaml. it generally includes the rest of the world.

The Hot Zone requires an accountability system, and a buddy rule. Free-lancing is often deadly.

The Warm zone is usually reserved for a RIC (Rapid intervention crew) and is where DECON takes place in the event of a HAZMAT (Hazordous Materials) or when ARFF (Alcohol Resistant Fire Fighting Foam) is used.

The Cold zone holds everything else.

Due to the natural chaos of an big incident, it is necessary for the Incdient Commander to attempt to keep track of where everyone is, and what they are doing.
